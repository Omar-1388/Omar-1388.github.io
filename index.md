### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was a favorite because after completing the lab the imagining and the animations were so facinating.
    I was able to find and fix problems with the help of my partner in order to make the animations work again.
    With removing objects and testing our progress it played animations when tested.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because I learned how to string varibles into words and created a sentince through it.
    We had to string variables into certain words and input them into a sentence that'll print A protien sandwich on bread with condament.
    Is one of the first Labs I did and it took a while until we got it right but that specific labb taught us a lot.

* Lab 7 

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because of the blackjack aspect but it was online. 
    The lab itself was pretty difficult because we had to set up if statements and write functions to calculate the correct value with all the cards especially Aces since they can be 2 values either 1 or 11.
    While it was difficult we had to ask our professor for help especially me since my partner kinda knew what he was doing so it felt more like they were both teaching me.
